# Music Control Applet for Cinnamon

A lightweight and minimal Cinnamon panel applet that allows you to control music playback and view the currently playing track directly from the panel.

This applet uses the **MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification)** standard, which means it works with most modern Linux media players and web browsers.

## 🖥️ Supported Players

Any application that supports **MPRIS**, including:

- Firefox
- Chrome / Chromium
- Spotify (web and desktop)
- VLC
- Rhythmbox
- Other MPRIS-compatible players

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The applet communicates with media players through **D-Bus** using the MPRIS interface:

- Playback control via:
  - `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player`
- Playback status via:
  - `PlaybackStatus`
- Track information via:
  - `Metadata` (`xesam:title`, `xesam:artist`)

The applet polls the active player at regular intervals to keep the UI updated while remaining lightweight.
